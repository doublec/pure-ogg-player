pure-ogg-player
===============

This is Pure library for playing Ogg files and contains various
utility functions for manipulating them.

It is very much a work in progress and currently only plays
Ogg files containing Vorbis streams. 

OpenAL is used for audio playback.

Building
========

Some files in the archive are automatically generated using
'pure-gen' run against the OpenAL and libogg header files. 
You can regenerate these by running:

  $ sh build.sh

The generated files are also included here so you don't need
to do this step.

Usage
=====

$ pure -i player.pure

Play a vorbis file:
> play_vorbis (sources!0) "test.ogg";

Load an Ogg file getting a lazy list of all pages in the file:

> using namespace ogg;
> let p = file_pages "test.ogg";
> p;
ogg_page (#<pointer 0x9e61cc8>,[...]):#<thunk 0xb7259b38>

Get a list of all packets and the serial number of the 
first logical bitstream in the list of pages:

> let (stream1,serialno) = packets p;
> serialno;
1426627898
> stream1;
  ogg_packet (#<pointer 0x9dd98f0>,[...]):#<thunk 0xb725bce0>

Get the next logical bitstream:

> let p2 = filter (\x->ogg_page_serialno x ~= serialno) p;
> p2;
#<thunk 0xb725dc30>
> let (stream2,serialno2) = packets p2;
> serialno2;
629367739
> stream2;
ogg_packet (#<pointer 0x9cfcf08>,[...]):#<thunk 0xb725c988>

Note that all these results are lazily evaluated so the entire
file is not loaded into memory. If we look at the original list
of pages you'll see what has been read so far (two pages):

> p;
ogg_page (...):ogg_page (...):#<thunk 0xb725dd98>

Get all the streams in the file:

> let s = all_streams p;

Get all the vorbis streams:

> let v = vorbis_streams s;

Get the first vorbis stream:

> let (v1, _) = v!0;

Decode the vorbis header packets and intialize a vorbis decoder
for the first vorbis stream:

> let decoder = vorbis_header v1;

Get a lazy list of all the decoded PCM data from the vorbis stream:

> let pcm = pcm_data decoder;
